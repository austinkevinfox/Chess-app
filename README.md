This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Tailwind Daisy UI.

Chess-app is a prototype for a chess game application.

1. First, the app supports a 2 player chess game. The app manages the valid moves and captures, and provides feedback to each player.

2. The goal is to support a user's mapping of chess pieces to cryptocurrencies. As a user captures his opponents pieces, he earn X amount in that designated crypto token.
